The place is very clean with a very accommodating staff and housekeeping personnel. I recommend this as a good place to stay in Cebu City. I've been here multiple times and stayed for at least 3-5 days. The room rate is quite expensive but worth it naman.,positive
"Our stay at Golden Peak Hotel in Cebu City was disappointing. While the room was clean, it was old, and the air conditioning in our assigned room was outdated and non-functional. By 1 AM, the heat became unbearable, waking us up. It was clear the aircon hadn’t been tested before we checked in. Although the staff promptly transferred us to a new room with a working unit, the interruption ruined our night, leaving us exhausted for the next day’s plans. I strongly suggest the hotel ensures all amenities are checked before assigning rooms to guests.",negative
Rooms need updating badly and a few more Welcoming Decorations in the Lobby Area. Service is good and close to some very good restaurants like House of Lechon and Banana Pancake Trail. Also near Ayala Mall. Pricing was fair.,negative
"One of the sh1tty hotels that i've been to. Lobbies and room are dusty, room has roaches, door does not lock up automatically, air-conditioning takes hours to cool and staff's are impolite, uncourteous and keeps looking at their phones! Food is also so-so and the thing that disgusts me is that their mugs and cups still has stains. [tripadvisor.com]",negative
"The place was so-so...? Service was nice, there was a bit of a language barrier but the staff were patient and understanding. Rooms did have a bath tub (but no plug) to actually soak. The beds were... outdated? Or I might have just gotten a weird room, not too sure. The amenities were nice as wel",negative
It was a nice stay on this hotel. Conveniently located and closed to everywhere. This is where my event was held and so thankful that i got a promotional rate.,positive
"This hotel is not worth 3 stars. The interior of the room is old, the photos do not match the room I had booked. There is no electrical outlet near the bed, only one in the bathroom (broken) and 2 behind the television and they are not suitable for tourists (you need an adapter) in the description of the room it is noted that the room is soundproofed, that's not true, there is a lot of outside noise. There should have been a safe, but there wasn't. I stayed in 5 different hotels in Cebu and this one is the worst, I didn't even stay. Don't go to this hotel, you can find much better for the same price.",negative
"Guests often mention its convenient location, friendly staff, clean rooms, and good amenities. However, some might also highlight areas for improvement, such as noise levels or room maintenance. Checking specific travel websites will give you a current and comprehensive view of guest experiences.",negative
Maybe some guests are satisfied with their stay. But I’m Not happy with my experience in this hotel. I happened to forget to retrieve my jacket that I hanged in the closet when we checked out. I remembered about it the next day. I called the hotel right away and told me  it wasn’t there. I’m sure it’s there. Integrity is always  important. So disappointed! I tried to ask them to check the CCTV but they refused. We won’t stay in this place ever again. Only the facade looks good. It didn’t pass our standard. That’s why we only stayed there for a night then we left the next day and didn’t stay another night although we payed for it already. We moved to another place. [trip.com],negative
Our room didn’t have a wifi at first so they moved us to another room that was good. But later on the wifi died again. Then 12pm at night they de used to continue building in the room next to us while the working were shouting I called reception and all they said is sorry. I would not recommend this hotel again. Very disappointed in this hotel.,negative
"Stayed in this hotel for 2 nights and unfortunately it was not a good experience. I dont recommend staying in this hotel especially to foreigners. Noise level is really disappointing, rooms are not properly maintained. The room windows can’t be locked and the safe box are not working. Customer service staff are not friendly. This is the first hotel that I have stayed that upon checking out you need to pay 500 peso extra because the towel is dirty. I was in rushed to check out as I was late for my flight and there was no time to argue. My husband just paid the amount they required to finish the issue as we are late for our flight. Honestly, they are making money out of it as before going down to reception I was the last one who used the towel and I left the towel without any stain. After few minutes one of the hotel staff surprised my husband saying you need to pay as the towel has stained. We ran out of time I haven’t take a picture but it is definitely not the towel we used. He might have taken that somewhere but that was not our towel used. Anyways, our experienced in your hotel was not pleasant at all but please dont make money with your tricks. My advice to people checking in this hotel wait for the hotel staff to come in your room. Don’t leave your room un attended if you are not cleared for check out as they are making many tricks just to get money out of it! Hoping that you you will served honesty in the future. Shame on you people! To the owner if you dont know this trick of your staff wake up and review your camera I check out on December 28, 2023 at 8:00 am. Also, even if the towel is dirty it is not the responsibility of the customer to leave the towel clean upon check out!",negative
The place is so cozy. The food served is delicious. The accommodation is not that expensive .,positive
"Nearby key sights, good enough for short business trips as easily recognizable by public transport. Complete but facilities are a bit outdated. Easy to deal with front desk and reservations. Overall, great value for its price.[trip.com]",positive
The location is alright. There are some touristy restaurants nearby such as House of Lechon. Rooms are spacious though it would be better if the floor has carpets. Breakfast is very good. Bonus: they have a sinulog performance during breakfast time if you are there during the festival! [trip.com],negative
"Would probably consider this a 1 to 2-star hotel. Most of the Staff are accommodating, courteous and polite, well, except for the guard who doesn't care if you have your hands full with luggage and wouldn't even lift a finger to open the lobby door for you despite repeated call outs. Lobby is not too inviting due to space limitations but it does have a nice floral scent. Function room that we got on the 5th floor was quite decent except for the mildew smell of the carpet. We had to request for the maintenance guy to place a room freshener/spray to compensate. Restrooms at the very least are well-maintained and clean. Could use an improvement on installing bidets, but its fine. Rooms are quite spacious which is a plus factor. Although, some of our companions didn't get the customary drinking water on their rooms. The hotel considers toothbrushes and slippers as extra amenities. They will charge you 50 pesos for it. Another downside is that you dont get any pleasant views looking outside your windows. Oh, hairdryers, as per the hotel staff are fixed into the rooms but only for the first 10 floors. But if you would only use it for a couple of minutes, the blowdryers suddenly becomes unfixed and they would allow you to borrow it. Likelihood to come back or recommend? Ehh.. probably 10%. Motels provide better offers. [tripadvisor.com]",negative
Room is spacious but needs an update. We stayed because of the typhoon Odette and we need signal and wifi for work. The staff are helpful but it was chaotic check in at the time. Understandable due to the typhoon aftermath. I like to go back once they are fully renovated.,negative
"Hotel is on good location. Close to Ayala Mall. Stuff are nice and friendly. Room is quite big. Cons : cleaning service is very bad. They didn't change towels or bed sheet. Towels i fine out that was left in chairs too dry. Very unpleasant surprise. Hot water doesn't work in my room. Toilets necessary they don't refill or change when they do "" cleaning"".",negative
What I love the most about this hotel is the excellent customer service of the staff. The hotel with the price we paid is not extraordinary but our stay was made perfect by the very polite staff.,positive
Good value for money if you get the Agoda price of 1600p. (For cheapest room) Their website price of 2800p is way too high. I booked on Agoda and upon check in asked how much to extend. I was told 2800p. (This is their walk-in price) I asked them to match the Agoda price and was told “ just book on Agoda sir”. After a month in the Philippines l am convinced Philippines companies don’t really understand how to do business. They would have to pay a commission to Agoda. Rooms are a bit run down now but very big.,negative
Our room didn’t have a wifi at first so they moved us to another room that was good. But later on the wifi died again.,negative
Checking in was fast and I love it.,positive
"What I dont like are: 1. Wifi is not working 2. Rooms are a bit old and furnitures are outdated 3. Hallway in 12th floor has a bad smell, i dont know if its from the carpet. 4. Elevators are a bit old 5. Buffet breakfast doesn't have much choices and cold also 6. Bathrooms needs to be renovated, tiles are filthy not to mention the weird heater tank that is not hidden.",negative
"This hotel is great. The buffet was delicious. The rooms have an electric heater, TV, and air-conditioning. The bathroom has a tub and hot or cold water but the water pressure sucks. WiFi signal was great but the password changes everyday so you have to ask for another password. All in all great!",negative
"Good price and location for a hotel within the city proper. Pros: Huge room. Comfortable bed. With considerable basic buffet breakfast. Respectful staff. Cons: Check-in process went around 30-minutes, booked 5 days ahead. We arrived 11:45pm late and sent email notice of our late arrival but the lady receptionist was clueless. As if they haven't expected our arrival. They gave us 2 separate rooms on 11th and 12th floor. Traveling with senior citizens.",negative
"A little outdated, but a reasonable price. You can get breakfast, buffet style. ( Good price) The wait staff was friendly and fantastic 😊",negative
"Stay: May 9-10. Staff are friendly, thoughtful and approachable. They will give you enough information regarding your queries and treat local and foreign customers fairly. The guards will immediately offer help with your luggage and transportation. The staff service is the main reason I haven't rate this hotel below 3 stars. I also liked our free upgrade from standard to deluxe room. Deluxe room is wide for 2 people. Rooms for improvement: - Elevator can be very crowded since it is the same building with other offices. Hotel rooms are located 10th floor to the 21st. This is the reason we had to transfer into another hotel since my mom can be claustrophobic with a crowded elevator (she's okay with an empty or not very crowded one) and we may get late with our appointments since there are times that the elevator can be fully loaded. - Food. 4 viands more or less. At the time, there was no jam for the bread. My stomach wouldn't enjoy the free breakfast, some are foods that have preservatives on it (ex. Hotdog, bacon). It would be great if you can offer a wide selection (and healthy ones!).",negative
Hotel had one elevator out of service which was an inconvenience shared by other visitors as well. Aside from that rooms were well kept and clean. No mini bar provided but the staff were friendly and promptly delivered on requests.,negative
"The most affordable, safe and cozy place for our family to stay every new year's eve for quite some time. The view of the uptown Cebu and the hills is fantastic. It's what we wait for everytime and we enjoy it in the safety of our room with huge wndows. Their no-frills restaurant for the simple breakfast buffet included in the stay is very good enough for us plus so near to Ayala center.",positive
Good friendly service. Rooms are clean & serviced daily. Had trouble connecting to internet when in my room even when I was given the password that changes every 24 hrs. Connecting in the lobby was fine. Different connection. Overall a nice place to stay. Good location.,positive

"Nice rooms and function hall on the 5th floor. Though parking spaces are up to the 4th only but the staff are very courteous, except some guys in the lobby. Only one working elevator out of three but the steep stairs will do for an exercise.",positive
"Nice view of the city!!! But for the food i think they need to revamp it, it just taste okay no wow factor on that. The function rooms look old. Overall, it is still one of the sought after hotels because of its accessiblity to the city proper, malls, hospitals and even Philhealth!",positive
Currently under renovation so it does not look pleasing inside and outside as of the moment. Also the elevator in the basement parking is still under construction too. You will be walking by the stairs from the parking area going to the lobby. Their female comfort room near the convention hall doesn't have tissue rolls available so you will have to bring your own tissue if you'll be needing to use tissue.,negative
"Situated close to the mall & very accessible. It offers buffet at its restaurant with a good selection of food. Its cafe is artistically designed & cozy. Staff is well-trained, corteous &helpful to the clients/customers",positive
"Avoid this place like a virus. Especially the Condos (apartments) they offer. Kim (the manager) will like constantly about what they offer. Told me there would be a cooking hob in the room and that there would be cleaning once a week. Neither of those things happened. No cooking hob, cleaning once every two weeks at best. And when you complain, she basically threatens to CALL THE POLICE. The rooms are also worn out and definitely NOT as advertised. [Dec 18 2019]",negative
Great hotel. Good location. Very clean. A bit dated but functional. It even has a safe in the room that works!,positive
I am fun of spending time at Milas for my lunch and snacks. They have good service and well trained crew. Clean and assured that their food preparation is best for the consumer's taste.,positive
It is a good place to stay overnight. There's a complimentary bottled water. Nice view of the city. The room is big enough for 5 persons. The room we got have 5 solo beds.,positive
"We attended a wedding at the venue. Their foods are simple but tasty. Lami pud ilang pork lechon! Also, enough space for parking.",negative
The service is phenomenal but the food standards are below expectations.,positive
Food offering is limited. They also have a limited number of staff to serve a large crowd. They are slow in accommodating special guest request such as additional food for walk-in training participants.,negative
Old rooms with outdated aircons. Good location one ride to downtown,positive
"Golden Peak Hotel and Suites is fine... Though before it was one of the most magnificient Hotels in Cebu City but the Hotel have not improved along with the tide of times with so many competitors sprouting out in Cebu City... the building is quite old, including it beds, furnitures and even telephones... I hope the hotel management can do a little bit of makeover to the hotel once I love so much in Cebu City... Though the hotel is quite old, the staff of the hotel are so polite and accommodating... The hotel is located to almost near to anything that you need in the metro... It is near the Ayala Center, to the Capitol, to BPO companies in Lahug... It is also just near to night life and bars Metro Cebu could offer...",negative
"Would have been nice if only you provided rags on your bathrooms to keep the floor dry. But nonetheless, your rooms are very nice and spacious.",negative
"Thank you for the good service, we will definitely come back again, the staff are the best!",positive
"The venue is good. The food is satisfying. However, there a problem with the missing property of my colleague which was not addressed appropriately.",negative
I love the view at the top. Hotel crew were always there to assist you. Location is very accessible,positive
Great service but had a little bit problem with the AC.,negative
Affordable room rates. Easy to find location. Five minutes away from Ayala Mall. It is just beside the crossing.,positive
"Room looks cheap Food tastes normal, nothing extraordinary Free breakfast Slightly expensive",negative
Rooms are quite old and room service was not done during my stay.,negative
Disappointing. How could be a fish fillet turned into a fried galunggong. Showing good rooms only to attract guests.,negative
Needs reconstruction though the city light in the top floor looks great! They should focus on that because it's their asset. :),negative
Staffs are friendly. Place is clean.,positive
One of Cebu's old hotel. Big rooms and inexpensive. New wing is better than the old wing.,positive
The room is ok but amenities were lacking,positive
"Bad experience,,,in buffet,drinks serve too late..very hot hallway and elevator,,:(",negative
Still needs improvement on their function rooms. Food are not so good & cold.,negative
Rooms are cheap but comfortable. Food is okay.,positive
Good service. Mediocre breakfast buffet. Has cable service.,positive
Some staff are rude.,negative
